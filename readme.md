# What this application does?

The application retrieves publications from multiple sources and applies NLP (Natural Language Processing) 
techniques to analyze them using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) methodology. 
VADER is a sentiment analysis tool that uses a lexicon and rule-based approach, designed specifically for 
capturing sentiments expressed in social media.

The visual component displays plots on a canvas, revealing the compound sentiment score generated by the 
VADER sentiment intensity analyser. This metric calculates the normalised sum of all lexicon ratings.

It's worth noting that 'compound' isn't just an average, it also takes into account how the words interact
in the overall context of the statement. VADER uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative measures,
including how words are intensified or lessened in the presence of modifiers or negations, and the order of 
words and phrases and their general context.
